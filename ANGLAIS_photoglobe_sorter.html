        <h1>Sorted! How I Organised 8 Years of City Breaks (15,000+ Photos!) Across Europe</h1>
        <h2>My review of PhotoGlobe Sorter – the tool that finally organised my weekend trip chaos AND gave me brilliant stats.</h2>


        <div class="bloc-auteur">
            <p>By <strong>Arthur Evans</strong><br>
            London, UK | Review written: 24th October 2025</p>
            <p>I work in finance, but live for those long weekends exploring European capitals. My camera roll was a mess – this sorted it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rating">
            ★★★★☆ (4.5 / 5.0)
            <p style="font-size: 0.7em; color: #333; font-weight: normal;">Spot on for travellers. The stats are a fun bonus!</p>
        </div>


        <blockquote>
            "Trying to find photos from that weekend in Berlin two years ago? Good luck, mate! My phone's 'Photos' folder was a disaster zone. Snaps from Paris next to Prague, Rome mixed with Riga. Just thousands of files with names like <code>IMG_5678.jpg</code>. It was a proper nightmare. I love travelling, but finding the photos afterwards? Not so much."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Alright? I'm Arthur. I love a good city break. Living in London, it's dead easy to hop on a budget flight for a long weekend. Paris, Rome, Berlin, Budapest, Krakow... I probably do 5 or 6 trips a year. I'm not a pro photographer, just snapping away on my iPhone and maybe a small mirrorless camera.</p>
        
        <p>My problem? All those brilliant weekends resulted in a digital mess. This is my story of finding a cracking little programme for €39 (about £34) called PhotoGlobe Sorter, which not only fixed my photo chaos but also gave me some fun travel bragging rights.</p>


        <h2>My Problem: The "European Capital Scramble"</h2>

        <div class="bloc-problema">
            <p>My photo library was basically my camera roll dump:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Roughly 15,800 photos</strong> and short videos.</li>
                <li><strong>8 years</strong> of weekend trips (since 2017).</li>
                <li><strong>180 GB</strong> of data, mostly on my main PC's hard drive.</li>
                <li>Folders: <code>iPhone Backups</code>, <code>Europe Trips</code>, <code>SORT LATER!!!</code>, <code>New Folder</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>The frustration was real. My mate asks, "Show us that picture of the Colosseum at night from your Rome trip last year."</p>

        <p>I'd scroll... and scroll... through thousands of photos. I'd find photos from Krakow, photos of my cat, photos from a pub night in London... but finding that *one* Rome photo? Forget it.</p>
        
        <p>I needed a simple way to <strong>organise my city break photos</strong>. The dream was a tool that could automatically <strong>sort photos by country and city</strong>. Manually creating folders for Paris, Rome, Berlin... just wasn't going to happen. I needed something automatic, and ideally, an <strong>offline photo software with no subscription</strong>.</p>


        <h2>What I Tried Before (Rubbish Options)</h2>

        <p>I looked around for the <strong>best photo organiser for weekend trips</strong>, but everything seemed too complicated or too expensive.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Alternative</th>
                    <th>Why it was pants</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Manual Sorting</strong></td>
                    <td>Life's too short. I'd rather be planning my next trip.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Google Photos</strong></td>
                    <td>I just don't trust them with all my travel data. Plus, I hate paying monthly fees for storage. Wanted a proper <strong>alternative to Google Photos UK</strong> that worked offline.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong></td>
                    <td>Way too much for what I need. It's like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. And again, the subscription cost adds up.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>I found PhotoGlobe Sorter while searching for <strong>"photo software with travel stats"</strong>. What really grabbed me wasn't just the one-off price (€39, about £34). It was the screenshot of the <strong>"Sort Summary" (Résumé du Tri) page</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>It showed graphs! Pie charts showing photos per country! A list of "Countries Visited"! For a bloke who likes stats, this was brilliant. It wasn't just an organiser; it was a fun travel tracker too. Sold!</p>

        <h2>The Process: Sorting 8 Years of Weekends in 25 Minutes</h2>

        <p>Bought the licence. Paid with my card, the €39 came out as <strong>£34.20</strong> on my statement. Easy peasy. Here's how I sorted my <strong>15,000+ travel photos</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: The "Euro Explorer" Structure (5 minutes)</h3>
        <p>This was dead simple. In the "Structure Builder", I set up my ideal travel log:</p>
        <p><code>Country</code> → <code>City</code> → <code>Year</code> → <code>Month</code></p>
        <p>Perfect. The software would read the GPS tag from my phone pics and automatically create folders like `France > Paris > 2024 > 05_May`. Genius!</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Old Camera Pics (Maybe 30 minutes)</h3>
        <p>My old mirrorless camera didn't have GPS. So, about 1,000 photos were "Location Unknown". The software has a <strong>manual geotagging</strong> tool. I just selected my old "Berlin_2018" photos, clicked Berlin on the map, and job done. Did this for a few old trips while watching the telly.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Hit 'Go' (25 Minutes)</h3>
        <p>I pointed the "Source" to my messy main photo folder. Pointed the "Destination" to a new folder on my external drive. Clicked "Start Sorting".</p>
        <p><strong>Total time for 15,800 photos: 25 minutes flat.</strong> Blimey, that was quick!</p>

        <h3>Step 4: The Result (Tidy Folders & Brilliant Stats!)</h3>
        <p>At the end, it popped up the "Sort Summary" page. And it was brilliant!</p>

        <div class="photo-placeholder">
            <div>📸</div>
            <div>[My 'Photos' folder BEFORE]</div>
            <div style="font-size: 0.9em;">Caption: Before. Just a massive dump of `IMG_xxxx.jpg` files. A proper mess.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-placeholder">
            <div>📸</div>
            <div>[Screenshot of the 'Sort Summary' stats page]</div>
            <div style="font-size: 0.9em;">Caption: After! Not just tidy folders, but this brilliant summary page. Shows 12 countries visited, photos per year... love it!</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>My folders were now immaculate. I could finally <strong>find photos from a specific city break</strong> instantly:</p>
        <p><code>G:\Travel_Archive\Italy\Rome\2023\</code><br>
        <code>G:\Travel_Archive\Germany\Berlin\2022\</code></p>
        
        <p>But the real fun was that Summary page. It told me I'd taken photos in **12 different countries** over 8 years, with France (Paris, mostly) being my top destination (28% of photos). Wicked!</p>

        <h2>What I Absolutely Love (The City Tripper's View)</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The "Sort Summary" Stats!</strong><br>
            This is the killer feature for me. The <strong>PDF report with photo locations</strong> and stats is fantastic. Seeing the pie chart of "Photos per Country" and the list of "Countries Visited" is just brilliant. It's like a visual travel diary generated automatically. Love it.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Automatic Sorting by COUNTRY > CITY.</strong><br>
            This is the core function, and it works flawlessly. It reads the GPS from my iPhone photos and just *knows* this was Paris, this was Prague. Finally, I can easily <strong>organise photos from Paris, Rome, Berlin</strong> etc.</li>

            <li><strong>One-Time Fee (£34)! No Subscription!</strong><br>
            Can't beat it. Pay once, use forever. Proper value for money. It's refreshing to see a <strong>cheap photo organiser software</strong> that's actually good.</li>
            
            <li><strong>100% Offline.</strong><br>
            My travel photos stay on my computer. No worries about privacy or needing an internet connection.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What's Not So Great (Minor Quibbles)</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows Only.</strong><br>
            My sister uses a Mac, she can't have it. Seems a missed opportunity.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Interface is a bit... basic.</strong><br>
            It does the job, but it's not the prettiest software you'll ever see. Very functional, not much flair. But who cares when it works this well?</li>

            <li><strong>Price in Euros (€).</strong><br>
            Minor annoyance paying in Euros from the UK. Cost me £34.20, which is fine, but seeing the price in GBP would be nice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who Should Buy This? (My Recommendation)</h2>

        <div class="bloc-solution">
            <p><strong>This software is SPOT ON for you if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ You're a frequent traveller (city breaks, holidays...) and your photos are a mess.</li>
                <li>✅ You want to <strong>automatically sort photos by COUNTRY and CITY</strong>.</li>
                <li>✅ You love seeing stats about your travels (like countries visited).</li>
                <li>✅ You hate monthly subscriptions and want a <strong>one-time fee photo sorter</strong>.</li>
                <li>✅ You use a Windows PC and value keeping your photos offline.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bloc-problema" style="margin-top: 20px;">
            <p><strong>Give it a MISS if:</strong></p>

                <li>❌ You are a <strong>Mac user</strong>.</li>
                <li>❌ You want a fancy photo *viewing* or *editing* tool (this just sorts files).</li>
                <li>❌ You prefer cloud services like Google Photos.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>FAQ (Stuff I Wondered About)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Does it really know the difference between Paris and Berlin?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, perfectly! As long as your phone camera has GPS enabled (most do), the photos contain the location data. The software reads "Paris, France" or "Berlin, Germany" and sorts accordingly.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How good are the travel stats?</strong><br>
        A: They're brilliant fun! The PDF report gives you a list of all countries it found photos from, a count of photos per country, and pie charts showing the distribution per country and per year. It's surprisingly detailed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Is £34 (€39) good value?</strong><br>
        A: Absolutely. It's a one-off payment. Compared to paying £9.99 *every month* for Lightroom, this is a bargain. It solves the problem permanently for the price of a couple of pints in central London.</p>

        <h2>My Photo Archive, 6 Months Later...</h2>

        <p>It's changed how I handle photos. I got back from Krakow last month. Plugged in my phone, ran PhotoGlobe Sorter on the new photos. Took literally 2 minutes. They all landed neatly in `.../Poland/Krakow/2025/09_September/`. Done.</p>
        
        <p>And my PDF report updated – Poland is now on my list of countries! It's actually motivating me to visit new places just to see them pop up on my stats page.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "This isn't just an organiser; it's my personal travel dashboard. It's turned the chore of sorting photos into a fun way to review my adventures. Seeing that list of countries grow is ace!"
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Final Verdict: Absolutely Spot On for the Price</h2>
