            <p>I'm a software engineer. I don't trust "free" services with my personal data. If I'm not the customer, I'm the product. This is my search for true data sovereignty.</p>
        </div>

            "The 'price' for 'free' photo management from Google or Apple is your privacy. You are handing over your entire life—your family's faces, your private moments, your vacation locations—for them to data-mine, train their AI on, and build marketing profiles. No, thank you. I needed a tool, not a service. I needed a <strong>local-first photo management</strong> solution that I control."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Hello. My name is David. Like most tech professionals, I have a massive data footprint. My photo library is my biggest liability. It's an <strong>802GB collection of 112,450 files</strong> from 15+ years of smartphones (JPEGs, HEICs), my DSLR (Canon .CR3 RAWs), and my drone (DNGs). It was an unmitigated disaster spread across 4 external drives.</p>
        
        <p>This article is a factual review of PhotoGlobe Sorter, a €39 (about $42) tool I found that finally solved my problem *without* compromising my number one principle: **my data stays on my hardware.**</p>


        <h2>My Problem: The 800GB "Data Liability"</h2>

        <div class="bloc-problema">
            <p>My archive was a nightmare for two reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Chaos:</strong> 15 years of files dumped into folders like <code>Backup_2019</code>, <code>iPhone_Import</code>, <code>Drone_Shots_Aug</code>. It was unusable.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Risk:</strong> My only "easy" option was to upload all 800GB to Google Photos or iCloud. This was a non-starter. I refuse to let an algorithm scan my kids' faces to "improve services." I was looking for a true <strong>alternative to Google Photos for privacy</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I needed a <strong>privacy-focused photo organizer</strong> that could <strong>sort my large photo collection</strong> efficiently. Specifically, I needed it to read the EXIF metadata (date, GPS) and <strong>batch organize photos by location and date, 100% offline</strong>.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>The Search for a Local, Non-SaaS Tool</h2>

        <p>My requirements were rigid: 1) Must be 100% local. 2) Must be a <strong>one-time purchase</strong> (I despise the SaaS subscription model). 3) Must be powerful enough to handle 100k+ files and RAW formats.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Software</th>
                    <th>Why It Failed My Test</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Google Photos</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>FAILS (Privacy):</strong> Requires full upload and scans everything. The business model *is* my data. Hard pass.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Apple Photos</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>FAILS (Ecosystem):</strong> Better privacy on-device, but pushes heavily for iCloud. It's a "walled garden" and I run a Windows PC.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>FAILS (Cost/Model):</strong> This is a <strong>local photo management software</strong>, but it's trapped in the $9.99/month SaaS model. It's also bloated with editing features I don't need for *organizing*.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>I found PhotoGlobe Sorter after searching for <strong>"local photo management software no subscription"</strong>. Its sales pitch was everything I wanted:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>100% Local:</strong> "No Cloud, No Tracking". This was my #1 requirement.</li>
            <li><strong>€39 Lifetime License:</strong> A <strong>one-time purchase</strong>. This is a clear, honest transaction. I give them money, they give me a tool. Perfect.</li>
            <li><strong>Metadata-Driven:</strong> It sorts by EXIF data (Date, GPS), not just file names. This is the only correct way to <strong>sort photos by GPS location</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Process: Analyzing 802GB of Chaos</h2>

        <p>I bought the license (approx. $42 USD via credit card). I installed it on my Windows 11 workstation. Here was my exact workflow.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Defining the Schema (5 Minutes)</h3>
        <p>The "Structure Builder" is logical. As an engineer, I appreciate it. I defined my ideal file structure:</p>
        <p><code>Year</code> → <code>Month</code> → <code>Country</code> → <code>State/Region</code> → <code>City</code></p>
        <p>This would finally sort my travel photos from my local files. It was the perfect schema to <strong>sort photos by country and city offline</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Pointing to the Sources (2 Minutes)</h3>
        <p>This was the critical test. I pointed the "Source" to *all four* of my external drives (<code>E:\</code>, <code>F:\</code>, <code>G:\</code>, <code>H:\</code>) simultaneously. My "Destination" was a new 2TB internal SSD.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: The Sort & Analysis (1 Hour 28 Minutes)</h3>
        <p>I hit "Start Sorting." The software began its multi-threaded scan. It read the metadata from 112,450 files, identified 14,000+ duplicates across the different drives, and copied the unique files into the new, clean structure.</p>
        <p><strong>Total time for 802GB of files: 1 hour, 28 minutes, 12 seconds.</strong></p>

        <h3>Step 4: The Result: Data Sovereignty</h3>
        <p>I opened my new <code>J:\Photo_Archive</code> drive. It was beautiful. Pure, logical order. Every file was exactly where it was supposed to be.</p>

        <div class="photo-placeholder">
            <div>📸</div>
            <div>[Screenshot of 4 messy external drive folders]</div>
            <div style="font-size: 0.9em;">Caption: BEFORE. Four external drives, 15 years of chaos. A data liability.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-placeholder">
            <div>📸</div>
            <div>[Screenshot of the new, clean folder structure: 2020, 2021, 2022...]</div>
            <div style="font-size: 0.9em;">Caption: AFTER. One clean, sorted archive. I am in full control of my data.</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Now I can find the photos from my trip to Japan in 2019 in 10 seconds:</p>
        <p><code>J:\Photo_Archive\2019\04_April\Japan\Tokyo\Shinjuku\</code></p>
        <p>This is how data *should* be managed.</p>

        <h2>What I Love (The Engineer's Perspective)</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>It's a "Tool," Not a "Service."</strong><br>
            This is the most important distinction. It doesn't "manage" my photos in a proprietary database. It sorts the *actual files* on my *actual hard drive*. If PhotoGlobe Sorter disappears tomorrow, I still have my perfectly sorted folder structure. This is true data ownership.</li>
            
            <li><strong>The PDF Report (The Data!)</strong><br>
            After the sort, it generates a PDF report. This is not a "fluffy" feature. It's a data-rich audit: "112,450 files scanned. 14,210 duplicates found. 98,240 unique files processed." It even includes a "Heatmap" of my GPS data, which is a fascinating visualization of my travel history.</li>

            <li><strong>The Simple ROI (Return on Investment)</strong><br>
            Adobe Lightroom is $9.99/month. That's $120/year. This <strong>€39 one-time purchase</strong> (about $42) paid for itself in less than 4 months of "subscription" cost, and it's now free forever. The math is simple.</li>

            <li><strong>It's 100% OFFLINE.</strong><br>
            I ran Wireshark (a network protocol analyzer) during the scan. The app made zero outgoing network calls, except to check the license once. It absolutely <strong>does not upload to a cloud</strong>. It's a true <strong>non-cloud photo manager</strong>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Downsides (Bugs & Feature Gaps)</h2>
        
        <p>No software is perfect. Here's what's missing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WINDOWS ONLY.</strong><br>
            This is the biggest drawback. No macOS or Linux version. This is a major limitation for a large part of the tech-savvy market.</li>
            
            <li><strong>The UI is Functional, Not "Pretty".</strong><br>
            The interface is built in what looks like a simple framework. It's not a beautiful, high-design product. It's a utility. It's clean, but it won't win design awards. I don't care, but some will.</li>

            <li><strong>The €39 Price Point.</strong><br>
            As an American, seeing the price in Euros is a minor point of friction. I'd prefer to see a clear $42 USD price.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who is this for? (The Litmus Test)</h2>

        <div class="bloc-solution">

        <h2>FAQ (My Pre-Purchase Questions)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Does PhotoGlobe Sorter upload my photos to the cloud?</strong><br>
        A: **NO.** I've verified it. It is 100% local. Your photos never leave your hard drive. This is its single biggest feature.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How does it sort 100,000 photos? Is it fast?</strong><br>
        A: It took 1.5 hours for 802GB on my machine (SSD to SSD). It's multi-threaded and reads metadata, not the whole file, so it's very efficient.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Can I add GPS data to old photos?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, it has a built-in <strong>manual geotagging</strong> tool. You select old photos, click on a map, and it writes the GPS data to the EXIF file. This is crucial for old, unscanned archives.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Is the 39 euro photo software legit?</strong><br>
        A: Yes. It's a one-time payment. I paid it. I got my license key 2 minutes later. It works. No tricks, no subscriptions.</p>

        <h2>My Archive, 6 Months Later: Total Control</h2>

        <p>My workflow is now perfect. I import photos from my phone/camera to an "INBOX" folder. Once a month, I run PhotoGlobe Sorter, which automatically sorts the "INBOX" into my main <code>J:\Photo_Archive</code>. </p>
        
        <p>My *entire* 800GB archive is now backed up (using Duplicati) to an encrypted Backblaze B2 bucket. I have a perfectly sorted local archive, and a fully encrypted, unreadable-by-anyone-else cloud backup. This is data sovereignty. *I* control the keys. *I* control the structure.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "This isn't just about 'cleaning up'. It's about taking back control. Google and Apple want you to believe that giving them your data is 'convenient'. PhotoGlobe Sorter proves that local, private, efficient management is not only possible, but superior."

        <h2>Final Verdict: The Best $42 I've Spent on Data Sovereignty</h2>

        <div class="bloc-verdict">
            <p>If you are a Windows user who values privacy and hates subscriptions, stop looking. This is the tool.</p>
            
            <p>It's not a "service." It's not an "ecosystem." It's a simple, powerful, local-first utility that does one job perfectly: it sorts your photo chaos using logic and metadata. It's the ultimate tool for reclaiming your digital memories from Big Tech.</p>
