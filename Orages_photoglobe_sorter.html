        <h1>From Chaos to Clarity: How I Organized 40,000+ Storm Chasing Photos (And Got a Killer Heatmap!)</h1>
        <h2>A Storm Chaser's review of PhotoGlobe Sorter – the offline tool that finally put my chase logs in order.</h2>


        <div class="bloc-auteur">
            <p>By <strong>Mark Johnson</strong><br>
            Norman, Oklahoma | Review Date: October 24, 2025</p>
            <p>I'm an amateur meteorologist and avid storm chaser. Location isn't just data, it's everything. My photos needed to reflect that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rating">
            ★★★★★ (5 / 5.0)
            <p style="font-size: 0.7em; color: #333; font-weight: normal;">Perfect for chasers and anyone needing precise location sorting.</p>
        </div>


        <blockquote>
            "You bust your tail driving 500 miles across Kansas, intercept a gorgeous supercell, nail the shot... then what? The photo ends up in a folder named 'CHASE_MAY_2023' along with 3,000 other images from Nebraska and Oklahoma. Try finding that *one* structure shot from Harper County, KS, six months later. It was a digital nightmare. My photo archive was as chaotic as the storms I chase."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Hey everyone. Mark here. If you're reading this, you probably understand the obsession. The pull of the open plains, the majesty of severe weather... and the drive to document it. I've been chasing storms across Tornado Alley for about 12 years now.</p>
        
        <p>My problem wasn't capturing the storms; it was capturing the *data*. Specifically, organizing my **40,000+ photos** by their precise location. This review is about how a simple, €39 (around $42) offline software called PhotoGlobe Sorter became the most crucial tool in my post-chase workflow.</p>


        <h2>My Problem: The "Digital Debris Field"</h2>

        <div class="bloc-problema">
            <p>My photo archive was a disaster:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Over 40,000 files</strong> (RAWs from DSLR, JPEGs from phone, dashcam stills).</li>
                <li><strong>12 years</strong> of chases across OK, KS, NE, TX, CO...</li>
                <li><strong>600+ GB</strong> of data on multiple drives.</li>
                <li>Folders: <code>May 2022 Chase</code>, <code>Nebraska Supercells</code>, <code>Backup_Drive_3</code>, <code>Random Storm Pics</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Trying to verify a past intercept location was impossible. Trying to compare wall cloud structures from different counties? Forget it. My photos, which *should* have been a valuable logbook, were just digital clutter.</p>
        
        <p>I desperately needed software for <strong>organizing weather photos</strong>, specifically the ability to <strong>sort photos by county and state</strong> using their GPS data. Manual sorting was out of the question. I needed an automatic way to <strong>archive severe weather photos</strong> logically.</p>


        <h2>What I Tried (And Why They Were a Bust for Chasers)</h2>

        <p>My requirements were specific: offline processing, accurate GPS sorting (down to county level ideally), and no monthly fees.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Software/Method</th>
                    <th>Why It Failed for Storm Chasing</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Manual Sorting</strong></td>
                    <td>Laughable. With thousands of photos per season, it's impossible.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Google Photos</strong></td>
                    <td>No way. Uploading 600GB of RAW files takes forever (especially on motel Wi-Fi), it costs money, and I don't want Google knowing my exact chase routes and locations. Hard pass on privacy grounds.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Adobe Lightroom (Classic)</strong></td>
                    <td>Can sort by location, but it's expensive ($10/month forever), complex, and overkill if you primarily need *organization*, not *editing*. Plus, its map module isn't its strongest feature.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>I found PhotoGlobe Sorter searching for <strong>"offline photo organizer sort by GPS coordinates"</strong>. What hooked me immediately were two things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The €39 lifetime price.</strong> No subscription!</li>
            <li><strong>The promise of a PDF Report with a Heatmap.</strong> A visual map showing where I've taken the most photos? For a chaser, seeing a heatmap of my activity across Tornado Alley sounded *awesome*.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This wasn't just about organizing; it was about visualizing my entire chasing history.</p>

        <h2>The Process: Taming 12 Years of Storms in 35 Minutes</h2>

        <p>I bought the license (came out to about $42 USD). Here's how I tackled my <strong>40,000+ storm photos</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: The Chaser's Logbook Structure (5 minutes)</h3>
        <p>Accuracy is key in chasing. In the "Structure Builder," I defined my ideal log:</p>
        <p><code>Year</code> → <code>Month</code> → <code>State/Region</code> → <code>County/City</code> → <code>Day</code></p>
        <p>(Note: The software uses "City" for the most specific location tag, which often corresponds to the County name in rural GPS data, or the nearest town). This structure would allow me to instantly find all photos from, say, `2023 > 05_May > Kansas > Ford County > 23_Tuesday`.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Checking GPS Data (Crucial!) (10 minutes)</h3>
        <p>Almost ALL my photos *have* GPS data (from my phone or a GPS logger connected to my DSLR). I just quickly scanned the "Geotagging" section to make sure there weren't many "Unknown Location" files. There were only a handful from an old point-and-shoot – I tagged those manually in 5 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Unleashing the Sort (35 Minutes)</h3>
        <p>I pointed the "Source" to my multiple messy drives. I set the "Destination" to a new 4TB drive labelled "CHASE ARCHIVE". I clicked "Start Sorting".</p>
        <p><strong>Total time for 40,000+ files (600GB+): 35 minutes flat.</strong> Impressive speed.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: The Result (Ordered Chaos & The Heatmap!)</h3>
        <p>The folders were perfect. But the first thing I did was open the generated PDF Report.</p>

        <div class="photo-placeholder">
            <div>📸</div>
            <div>[Screenshot of chaotic chase folders]</div>
            <div style="font-size: 0.9em;">Caption: Before. A jumble of folders like `Chase_May_22`, `OK_Supercells`, `Backup`. Impossible to find specific events.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-placeholder">
            <div>📸</div>
            <div>[Screenshot of the PDF Heatmap showing hotspots in OK/KS/NE]</div>
            <div style="font-size: 0.9em;">Caption: After! Not only are the files sorted, but this incredible Heatmap shows exactly where I've spent my time chasing across the Plains. Amazing!</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The PDF report was gold. It listed every State and County I'd taken photos in. And the heatmap! It clearly showed my main chase territories in central Oklahoma, southwest Kansas, and southern Nebraska glowing bright red. It was a visual representation of 12 years of chasing.</p>

        <h2>What I Absolutely Love (The Chaser's Perspective)</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>THE HEATMAP & PDF REPORT!</strong><br>
            This is the killer feature for anyone obsessed with location data. Seeing my chase history visualized on a map is incredibly satisfying and useful. I can literally see my most productive chase corridors. This feature alone is worth the price. It helps <strong>create a heatmap of storm chase locations</strong> effortlessly.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Sorting by State AND County/City.</strong><br>
            This granularity is essential. Just sorting by 'Kansas' isn't enough. I need to know *which county* in Kansas. The software pulls the most specific location tag it can find (often the county name in rural areas) and uses that for the final folder level. Perfect for <strong>sorting photos by county and state</strong>.</li>

            <li><strong>100% Offline & No Subscription.</strong><br>
            My chase logs and locations are my data. I don't want them uploaded anywhere. This software respects that. And paying once ($42) is infinitely better than a recurring fee.</li>
            
            <li><strong>It's Fast and Handles RAW Files.</strong><br>
            It chewed through 600GB of RAW and JPEG files in 35 minutes. It's built for large volumes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Minor Turbulence (The Downsides)</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows Only.</strong><br>
            A big limitation. Many creatives and scientists use Macs.</li>
            
            <li><strong>UI is Functional, Not Fancy.</strong><br>
            It looks like a utility tool, not a sleek modern app. It works perfectly, but don't expect visual fireworks.</li>

            <li><strong>Relies Heavily on Good GPS Data.</strong><br>
            If your photos *don't* have GPS data, the location sorting won't work well without significant manual tagging. For chasers who rely on GPS, this isn't an issue, but be aware.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who Needs This in Their Chase Vehicle?</h2>

        <div class="bloc-solution">
            <p><strong>This software is ESSENTIAL if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ You are a <strong>storm chaser, weather photographer, or field researcher</strong>.</li>
                <li>✅ **Precise location data (State, County, GPS)** is critical for your work or hobby.</li>
                <li>✅ You want to visualize your photo locations on a <strong>heatmap</strong>.</li>
                <li>✅ You need an <strong>offline solution</strong> with no subscriptions.</li>
                <li>✅ You have thousands of photos that need structure based on location.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bloc-problema" style="margin-top: 20px;">
            <p><strong>Steer Clear if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ You use a <strong>Mac</strong>.</li>
                <li>❌ Most of your photos lack GPS data (and you won't manually tag them).</li>
                <li>❌ You need advanced photo editing features.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>FAQ (Chaser Questions)</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Does it really sort down to the County level?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, if your GPS data includes it (most smartphones and GPS loggers do). It uses the most specific location tag available, which is often the county in rural areas crucial for chasing.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I customize the folder structure for my chase logs?</strong><br>
        A: Absolutely. The "Structure Builder" is very flexible. You can put Year first, or State first, or include Day – whatever fits your logging style.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How accurate is the Heatmap?</strong><br>
        A: It's based entirely on the GPS coordinates in your photos. So, it's as accurate as your data. It perfectly highlighted my known chase hotspots.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Is $42 (€39) a good price for this?</strong><br>
        A: For the precision, the offline privacy, the lack of subscription, and that amazing heatmap feature? It's ridiculously cheap. It's less than a tank of gas for one chase day.</p>

        <h2>My Workflow Now: Organized from the Field</h2>

        <p>My post-chase routine is transformed. I dump all photos from the day's chase into an "INGEST" folder. Run PhotoGlobe Sorter. It instantly files everything into the correct State/County/Day folder. Takes 5 minutes.</p>
        
        <p>My entire archive is now structured, searchable (by folder), and visually represented by that awesome heatmap. I can finally use my photo archive as the valuable chase log it was always meant to be.</p>
