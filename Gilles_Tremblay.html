            "Every April, I drive our RV 2,500 km from Naples, Florida, back to Brossard, Québec. Every October, I drive back south. For 12 years, my digital life has been a complete mess. I'd find photos of my granddaughter making a snowman in March, and the very next file, <code>IMG_4073.jpg</code>, would be my golf swing in Naples from two days later. It was impossible to find anything. For 12 years, I just kept dumping them into one giant 'Photos' folder on our old Windows PC. This is the story of how I fixed it... for good."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Hello, my name is Gilles. My wife and I are "snowbirds," as they say. We spend our beautiful summers in Québec, near our family, and our winters in a lovely condo community in Naples, Florida. We are very lucky.</p>
        
        <p>But this lucky "two-life" situation created a digital nightmare. I take photos of the grandkids' hockey games, our summer hikes up Mont-Saint-Bruno, and then *thousands* of photos of the beach, the golf course, and our friends in Florida. They were all mixed up. This article is my review of a small, €39 (about $58 CAD) program called PhotoGlobe Sorter that completely solved my biggest retirement headache.</p>


        <h2>My Problem: The 'Two-Life' Photo Chaos</h2>

        <div class="bloc-probleme">
            <p>To be perfectly clear, my "My Pictures" folder was a disaster zone:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>48,500 photos</strong> and 320 short videos.</li>
                <li><strong>12 years</strong> of retirement memories (since 2013).</li>
                <li><strong>218 GB</strong> of data on three different external hard drives.</li>
                <li>Folder names like: <code>Florida 2017</code>, <code>Grandkids</code>, <code>New Folder (2)</code>, <code>Camera Dump</code>, <code>From Marthe's iPad</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>My biggest frustration? My wife, Marthe, would ask for a specific memory. "Gilles, find that photo of our 10th-anniversary dinner in Key West. Remember? From 2018."</p>

        <p>An hour later, I'd give up. I'd search <code>Florida 2018</code>. Nothing. I'd search <code>Key West</code>. Nothing. Why? Because the photo was filed under <code>DSCN0451.jpg</code> in a folder named <code>Import 2019</code> (when I finally got around to it), right next to photos of our grandson's first birthday in Brossard.</p>
        
        <p>I didn't need a fancy program. I just needed a simple, automatic way to <strong>manage my photos from Québec and Florida</strong>. I needed a tool that was smart enough to know that a photo taken in Naples belongs in a "Florida" folder, and a photo taken in Brossard belongs in a "Québec" folder. That's all!</p>
        <p>Finding a <strong>software to sort photos by location and date</strong> that wasn't a complicated monthly subscription was my goal. I was failing. This <strong>how to sort 12 years of photos</strong> problem was my white whale.</p>


        <h2>What I Tried Before (And Why It Failed)</h2>

        <p>Believe me, I tried the "free" options first. I'm retired, I'm careful with my money. I was looking for the <strong>best photo organizer for retirees</strong>, not a professional studio tool.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Alternative I Tried</th>
                    <th>Why It Was a Dud (for me)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Sorting Manually</strong></td>
                    <td>Are you kidding? I'm 71, not 30. That's not retirement, that's a full-time job. I'd rather be golfing.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Google Photos</strong></td>
                    <td>I just don't like "the cloud." I don't want my personal family photos on some server in California. And I *hate* subscriptions. I don't want another monthly bill. I needed an <strong>alternative to Google Photos without a subscription</strong>.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Windows Explorer (Right-click > Sort by)</strong></td>
                    <td>It's a lie! Half the time, the "Date Taken" is blank, or it shows "Date Modified." It's useless for sorting my old camera photos and my wife's iPad photos together.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>I found PhotoGlobe Sorter after searching (for about the tenth time) for <strong>"easy photo sorting software for seniors"</strong>. The website looked simple. But one feature made me stop.</p>
        
        <p>It wasn't the price (though the <strong>€39 one-time fee</strong> was very attractive). It was the promise that it could <strong>"organize photos by Country and State automatically."</strong></p>
        <p>That was it. That was the magic phrase. It understood that "Florida" (a State) and "Québec" (a Province, or "Region" as they call it) were the two things I needed to separate. This was the tool I'd been looking for.</p>

        <h2>My Step-by-Step: Sorting 12 Years in One Afternoon</h2>

        <p>I'm no computer whiz, so I was nervous. But I bought the licence. Here’s exactly what I did to <strong>organize my 48,500 photos</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: The 'Structure' (The "Brains" - 10 Minutes)</h3>
        <p>This is the most "technical" part, and it was still dead simple. You go to "Organize Photos" and there's a "Structure Builder." You just drag and drop the little blocks to tell it *how* you want your folders.</p>
        <p>My magic formula for my "two-life" problem was this:</p>
        <p><code>Country</code> → <code>Region/State</code> → <code>Year</code> → <code>Month</code></p>
        <p>This was my "Aha!" moment. This would create a `Canada` folder and a `USA` folder. Inside `Canada`, it would make a `Québec` folder. Inside `USA`, it would make a `Florida` folder. Then, inside those, it would sort everything by date. Brilliant!</p>

        <h3>Step 2: The 'No-GPS' Photos (About 1 hour)</h3>
        <p>The software sorts using the GPS data in your photos. My iPhone does this automatically. But my trusty old Canon S95 camera (from 2010-2016) did not. So the software listed about 5,000 photos as "Unknown Location."</p>
        <p>But they have a tool for this! It's called "Geotagging." I selected all 2,000 of my old "unknown" Florida photos, clicked on Naples on the map, and hit "Apply." Done. I did the same for my old Québec photos. It took me about an hour while I listened to the radio. You only have to do this *once*... ever.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: The Big Sort (55 Minutes, 12 Seconds)</h3>
        <p>This was the scary part. I selected my giant, messy "My Pictures" folder as the "Source." I plugged in a brand new 1TB external hard drive as the "Destination." I took a deep breath and clicked "Start Sorting."</p>
        <p>A progress screen popped up. It showed me it was processing 14.7 photos per second. I went and made a coffee and sat with Marthe on the balcony. We came back in under an hour.</p>
        <p><strong>Total time for 48,500 photos: 55 minutes and 12 seconds.</strong></p>

        <h3>Step 4: The Result (I Honestly Got a Bit Emotional)</h3>
        <p>I opened the new hard drive. My heart was pounding a bit. And there, on the screen, were two folders:</p>
        <p><code>\Canada</code><br>
        <code>\USA</code></p>
        
        <p>I double-clicked <code>\USA</code>. Inside was one folder: <code>\Florida</code>.<br>
        I double-clicked that. Inside: <code>\2013</code>, <code>\2014</code>, <code>\2015</code>...<br>
        I double-clicked <code>\2018</code>. Inside: <code>\05_May</code>, <code>\06_June</code>, <code>\11_November</code>...<br>
        I clicked on the folder for our anniversary. And there it was. The Key West photo. I found it in 15 seconds.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What I Absolutely Love (The 'Snowbird' Highlights)</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>It Just Works. Period.</strong><br>
            It did exactly what it promised. It <strong>separated my photos from Québec and Florida</strong> perfectly. This one feature is worth the entire price. It solved my 12-year problem.</li>
            
            <li><strong>100% Offline and NO Subscription!</strong><br>
            This is my favourite part. I hate monthly bills. This is a <strong>one-time fee photo sorter</strong>. I paid my ~$58 CAD once, and I own the software forever. My photos never leave my computer, they don't go to "the cloud." This is the best <strong>offline photo management software for Windows</strong> I could find.</li>

            <li><strong>The Structure Builder is My Favourite Toy.</strong><br>
            The magic formula (`Country` → `Region/State` → `Year`) is my dream. I can find *anything* now. My golf games from 2019? Easy: `\USA\Florida\2019`. Grandkids' first snow day in 2021? Easy: `\Canada\Québec\2021\01_January`.</li>

            <li><strong>The PDF Report (A Fun Bonus).</strong><br>
            I didn't think I'd care about this, but after the sort, it generates a PDF report. It showed a "heatmap" of North America. There were two giant red dots: one over Brossard, QC, and one over Naples, FL. It was a perfect map of my retired life. My wife got a real kick out of that.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What's Not Perfect (A Few Grumbles)</h2>
        
        <p>Now, it's not all sunshine. To be honest, here are a few things that bothered me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>It's Windows Only.</strong><br>
            My daughter and her family all use Apple MacBooks. They can't use this software. She's the one who really needs this (her "Desktop" folder is a nightmare!), but it's not available for her.</li>
            
            <li><strong>The Price is in Euros (€39).</strong><br>
            This was just... weird. I'm in Canada, buying software from a website in English, and the price is in Euros? My Visa card charged me **$58.14 Canadian Dollars**. It's still a fantastic bargain for a lifetime licence, but it was confusing at checkout.</li>

            <li><strong>It's a "Tool," Not an "Album".</strong><br>
            This is important. This software is a "sorter." It's a tool, like a hammer. It's not "pretty" like Google Photos or Apple Photos. It doesn't make slideshows or albums. It just builds your folders perfectly. For me, this is a *good* thing. It's simple and does one job well.</li>

            <li><strong>You Have to Do That *One* Hour of Prep.</strong><br>
            The manual "Geotagging" for my old photos *was* a bit of a chore. You have to set aside an hour or two to get your old, non-GPS photos tagged. But, you only do it once. Ever. It's worth the small effort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is This For You? (My Final Advice)</h2>

        <div class="bloc-solution">
            <p><strong>This software is PERFECT for you if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ You are a <strong>"Snowbird"</strong> (like me!) or live in two different places.</li>
                <li>✅ You are retired and just want a <strong>simple tool that works</strong>, with no monthly bills.</li>
                <li>✅ You are looking for a way to <strong>organize photos by province and state</strong>.</li>
                <li>✅ You hate "the cloud" and want your photos to stay 100% private and offline.</li>
                <li>✅ You have 10+ years of photo chaos and are finally ready to fix it.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="bloc-probleme" style="margin-top: 20px;">
            <p><strong>This is NOT for you if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ You are a <strong>Mac user</strong>. (It's Windows only).</li>
                <li>❌ You want a program to <strong>edit your photos</strong> (change colours, etc.). This doesn't do that.</li>
                <li>❌ You *like* the cloud and want your photos to sync with your phone (just use Google Photos).</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>FAQ - Questions I Had Before I Bought</h2>

        <p>These are the questions I had. I hope my answers help you.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How does it know the difference between Québec and Florida?</strong><br>
        A: It reads the hidden GPS data in your photos (from your smartphone, usually). It sees "Naples, Florida, USA" and "Brossard, Québec, Canada." If a photo has no GPS (like from my old camera), you use the manual "Geotagging" tool to tell it where it was taken.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is it hard to organize photos by province and state?</strong><br>
        A: No, that's the easiest part. It's a block called "Region/State" in the Structure Builder. You just drag it where you want it. It automatically knew "Québec" and "Florida" without me doing anything.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Is this really easy photo sorting software for seniors?</strong><br>
        A: I can say yes. I am 71 and I am not a "computer person." I figured it out in 10 minutes. The interface is simple. It's not overwhelming.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What if I have 50,000 photos? Is that too many?</strong><br>
        A: No. It handled my 48,500 photos in under an hour. The website says it's built for massive collections.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Is it *really* a one-time fee? No tricks?</strong><br>
        A: Yes. I was suspicious too. But it's true. I paid my ~$58 CAD once, and that's it. No more bills. Ever. All updates are included. This is rare and wonderful.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can it find a specific photo in my massive archive?</strong><br>
        A: It's not a "search" tool. It's an "organizing" tool, which is better. It doesn't "find" your Key West photo. It *structures your archive* so *you* can find it in 15 seconds, just by clicking `USA > Florida > 2018`. It's a permanent fix.</p>

        <h2>My "New" Life, 6 Months Later...</h2>

        <p>The best part isn't the clean hard drive. It's the peace of mind. I no longer dread importing photos. </p>
        <p>I just spent all winter in Florida (2025). I took about 1,500 photos. When we got back to Brossard in April, I plugged in my camera and my iPhone. I ran PhotoGlobe Sorter and pointed it at my "Sorted Photos" drive. It took **5 minutes**. It automatically found all the new photos, and *poof*... they were all filed away in `\USA\Florida\2025\`. It's no longer a chore. It's a 5-minute task twice a year.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "I'm finally *enjoying* my memories instead of just 'storing' them (and losing them). Marthe and I actually sit down and look at our old travel photos now because we can *find* them. This simple tool gave us our own history back."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Final Verdict: The Best $58 I've Spent on my Computer, Bar None</h2>

        <div class="bloc-verdict">
            <p>If you are a snowbird, or anyone who splits their time between two homes, this is a "must-buy." Stop thinking about it. The 12 years of frustration I had isn't worth it.</p>
            
            <p>This is the simple, permanent fix for the "two-life" photo problem. It's the only tool I found that is made for <strong>organizing photos by province and state</strong> so easily, and the <strong>one-time fee</strong> makes it a total bargain.</p>
